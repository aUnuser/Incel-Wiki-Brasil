      Incel is an academic sociological term that is short for involuntary celibate or involuntary celibacy (also called "inceldom"), an adverse life circumstance. An analogy many incels often find elucidating would be comparing the state of lifelong inceldom to other common adverse life circumstances, such as poverty. Inceldom was recognized in academia as a sociological phenomenon in the landmark Donnelly study published in 2001. Many further peer-reviewed academic papers have since been written, portraying involuntary celibacy as a (mostly) adverse life circumstance rather than exclusively describing a specific internet subculture.
      
      Academic researchers who have examined involuntary celibacy (though not all use that exact term) include: Denise Donnelly, Elizabeth Burgess, Laura Carpenter, Theodor F. Cohen, and Menelaos Apostolou. Brian Gilmartin also conducted extensive research into the closely linked concept of love shyness. The initial study explicitly dealing with the topic of involuntary celibacy, the Donnelly study, defined incels as all adults who fail to find a sexual partner for six months or more, despite their desire for one. However, among self-identified incels, there is often fervent disagreement about the exact definition of what an incel is.

      This wiki takes the stance, in agreement with the early academic research into the topic, that incel is not a movement or a community, but a gender-neutral life circumstance. Incels, both self-identified and not, are highly diverse politically, racially, religiously, and socioeconomically.

      Online communities of self-described incels are also extremely diverse in terms of racial/ethnic make-up, political beliefs, and user's views on the ultimate causes of involuntary celibacy and the possible solutions proposed to alleviate this circumstance. This user diversity in origin and ideology is precisely what one would expect for communities organized around a life circumstance, rather than any concrete ideology.

      No philosophy or subculture represents all incels. Involuntarily celibacy is also by no means uncommon, either throughout history or in contemporary societies. For instance, among American millennials, 15-30% are incels, roughly 51% do not have a steady partner, roughly 30% are often or always lonely, and roughly 22% have no friends.

      Current prominent incel forums include: Incels.is, love-shy.net, and /r/foreveralone. No mass-shooters or other criminals identified by the media as 'incels', or that self-described as such, are known to have been primarily motivated to commit their crimes by online communities devoted to involuntary celibacy. Some of these individuals visited 4chan, PUAhate and /r/MGTOW which were/are not incel communities. The Incel Wiki does not condone the violence committed by these individuals.

      The [Battle of St. Charles]() was fought on June 17, 1862, at St. Charles, Arkansas, during the American Civil War. Earlier in 1862, a force commanded by Samuel R. Curtis, a major general of the Union Army, became bogged down in northern Arkansas. A Union relief force was sent up the White River to resupply Curtis. The Confederates had constructed fortifications near St. Charles.
